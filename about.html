            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                This project is an interactive 3D Web Application on the theme of recycling, aiming to popularise the recycling process of metal, glass and paper. The application introduces the basic information of these three types of waste, and also selects a coke can, a wine bottle, and a pizza box as representative models, so that users can experience the recycling process by clicking buttons to trigger animations and sound effects. The project uses Three.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other technologies, and also incorporates a responsive layout that allows the page elements to adapt when the user changes the size of the window.

            <h2>1. 3D Models</h2>
            <p>
                I made three models in blender:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first model is a Coca-Cola can, the bottle is modelled using a cylindrical structure, I partly referred to the modelling tutorials given by my teacher and the steps in the online instructional videos, but only learned the methods and made adjustments based on my own previously constructed can model. As for the materials, two different materials were set for the body and the mouth of the bottle. The bottle was UV-expanded to map the Coca-Cola label and set to metallic=0.78 and roughness=0.22 using the Principled BSDF node to simulate a reflective surface. The mouth of the bottle was set to fully metallic (metallic=1.0, roughness=0.15) to provide some visual contrast.</li>
                <li>The second model is a wine bottle, which consists of two parts: the bottle and the cap. During the modelling process, I also referred to some video tutorials to make the neck transition and mouth details of the bottle better, while the cap part is a separate model like the pull ring of the Coke can model, which is for the convenience of subsequent animation effects. The bottle is made of dark transparent glass, using Principled BSDF nodes and Transmission to simulate the glass. The label area of the bottle is UV-expanded to fit the label image to the bottle using mapping and mixing nodes. The cap was set to non-metallic and high roughness (0.7) to simulate wood.</li>
                <li>The third model is a pizza box, consisting of two parts: the lid and the bottom. I followed some video tutorials and created the box by extruding a cube, adding structural details such as the locking mechanism. The material is set up using a Principled BSDF node, with high roughness (0.859) and a metallic value of 1.0 to simulate the texture of cardboard. Although cardboard is not metallic in reality, I found that setting the metallic value to 1.0 produced a visual effect that more closely resembled real cardboard. A texture map of the pizza boxâ€™s outer packaging was also applied.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Design</h2>
            <p>
            The website uses green as the main color, combined with a light background, to match the theme of environmental recycling. The website is made up of five pages: a homepage, an about page, and three model pages. All pages have a fixed navigation bar at the top. Users can click the page names in the navigation bar to jump to different pages. When clicking "Recycled Items", a white dropdown menu appears, where users can select an item to go to its model page. On the homepage, below the banner image, there are three sections showing different types of recyclable materials with pictures and short descriptions. Users can also click the "Find More" button under each section to visit the corresponding model page. The three model pages have a similar layout. Each page first shows a recycling education video, and then a 3D model interaction area below. The model area includes interactive buttons that allow users to play animations, change lighting modes, and switch camera views. There are also labels next to the buttons showing the current status. 
            </p>

            <h2>3. Integration</h2>
            <p>
            This project uses Three.js to load .glb format models created in Blender into the web pages, with each model displayed on a separate page. The project is organized in a modular way using model.js, viewer.js, and controller.js scripts. Users can control model animation playback, lighting mode switching, and camera view adjustment through interactive buttons. All resources used on the website, including images, audio files, and fonts, are organized into separate folders and referenced through HTML, for example, embedding recycling education videos using iframes. The website also attempts to adopt a responsive layout to ensure that page elements adjust automatically when the window size changes.

            <h2>4. Interaction</h2>
            <p>
            In the model interaction area, users can click the "Wireframe" button at the bottom to toggle the wireframe display mode, and use the "Rotate" button to rotate the model. Each model page also provides different animation effects: For the can model, the "Open Can", "Crush", and "Recycle" buttons correspond to the opening of the pull tab, crushing, and recycling processes respectively, with matching sound effects played during each animation. For the glass bottle model, the "Open" and "Break" buttons trigger the cap opening and bottle breaking animations.For the pizza box model, the "Open Box" and "Crush" buttons correspond to the lid opening and box crushing animations. Lighting modes include full lighting and contrast lighting, while camera views include the front view, side view, and top view. By clicking the reset button, users can restore the model to its initial state.

            <h2>5. Implementation</h2>
            <p>
            In the implementation of this project, model.js uses GLTFLoader to load .glb model files, set the initial position of the models, and control the animations using AnimationMixer; viewer.js sets up the basic Three.js scene, including configuring the renderer, camera, and lighting; controller.js handles the user interaction logic, including triggering animations, switching lighting modes, changing camera perspectives, and resetting the model to its initial state. All models are created and animated in Blender, with animation clips packed during export. On the webpage, buttons are bound to the animation actions, and when users click the buttons, the corresponding animation will play.

            <h2>6. Deeper Understanding</h2>
            <p>
            During the implementation of this project, I encountered several challenges. In terms of model creation, the modeling of the pull tab of the soda can was particularly challenging. Not only did it need to fit the bottle cap as closely as possible, but it also had to work seamlessly with the animation of the cap opening. Therefore, I carefully handled the modeling details and angles of the pull tab during the process. In the case of the shattered bottle animation, the challenge was how to split the model into two separate parts and simultaneously control their movement and rotation in the animation. I successfully simulated the broken bottle effect using keyframe animation and added sound effects to enhance the realism of the animation. Additionally, I believe that the web design also demonstrates a deeper understanding of the project. For the logo in the top navigation bar, I did not directly import an image of the recycling logo. Instead, I created a custom SVG graphic to represent the logo using pure HTML and CSS.

            <h2>7. Testing and Deployment</h2>
            <p>
            During the development process, I conducted multiple tests on the 3D application to ensure that all interactive features and animations ran smoothly. Based on feedback from my classmates, I realized that the animations lacked corresponding sound effects. To improve the user experience, I added sound effects to the animations. For deployment, I used the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code to open and debug the webpage locally. The GitHub code repository URL for the 3D app is: <a href="https://github.com/zpyq/Web-3D-Application.git" target="_blank">https://github.com/zpyq/Web-3D-Application.git</a>. 
            Additionally, I uploaded the website to the Sussex server, which can be accessed via the following link in a browser:
